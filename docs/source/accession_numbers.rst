Accession numbers
============================

MaveDB accession numbers use the `URN (Uniform Resource Name) format <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141>`_.
The accession numbers have a hierarchical structure that reflects the relationship between
experiment sets, experiments, score sets, and individual variants in MaveDB.
