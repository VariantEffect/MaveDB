Data organization
============================

MaveDB has three kinds of records: experiment set, experiment, and score set.
These records are organized hierarchically.
Each experiment set can contain multiple experiments and each experiment can contain multiple score sets.
MaveDB also supports meta-analysis score sets, which are based on one or more existing score sets.
Each of these record types are described in more detail below.
