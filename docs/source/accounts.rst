User account management
==================================

User account authentication in MaveDB is handled through `ORCID iD <https://orcid.org/>`_.
If you do not have an `ORCID iD <https://orcid.org/>`_, you can register a new one for free using their service.

Your MaveDB account will be created once you log in for the first time,
and this step is required before you can be added as a :ref:`contributor<Contributor roles>` on any MaveDB records.

Setting an email address
###################################

MaveDB can only view public email addresses associated with your `ORCID iD <https://orcid.org/>`_.
If you do not have one of these set and would like to receive emails from MaveDB,
you can provide an email address using the `Profile settings page <https://www.mavedb.org/profile/settings/>`_
(requires login).

MaveDB will send automatic emails when upload tasks complete or when your dataset permissions are changed.
MaveDB maintainers will also use this email address to notify you of important updates that affect the usability of
your datasets.

API access tokens
###################################

Users can generate an API access token to access :ref:`private datasets<Temporary accession numbers>` via API
using the `Profile settings page <https://www.mavedb.org/profile/settings/>`_ (requires login).

Only one API access token can be active for a given account.
Generating a new token will invalidate the old one.
