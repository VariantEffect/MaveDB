Contributor roles
====================================

MaveDB supports three different roles that can be assigned to contributors for each experiment and score set record:
administrators, editors, or viewers.

.. note::
   All contributors will be listed similarly on the associated MaveDB page regardless of role.

**Administrators** can view or modify data and metadata, add or remove contributors, and publish score sets.
The creator of an experiment or score set will automatically be added as an administrator.
Every experiment or score set will always have at least one administrator.

Administrators can add other contributors to experiments and score sets as administrators, editors, or viewers using
their `ORCID iD <https://orcid.org/>`_.
Contributors must first log into MaveDB at least once to create their account before they can be added.

**Editors** can view or modify data and metadata.
This role is intended for collaborating researchers who will edit the experiment or score set before or after it is
made public.

**Viewers** can view data and metadata.
This role is intended for collaborating researchers who should be associated with the experiment or score set,
but do not need to make changes in MaveDB.
